💡 Inspiration

Just like every other child, when we were kids, we were fascinated by the endless sky and the innumerable number of stars that are unexplored (yet).
Always wanted to know more about stars and do something with astronomical data steered our team to take up a project using astronomical data.
Having an in-house expert – Professor Ignacio Becker motivated us further and we took upon this challenge.

Here is a link of research paper that inspired the project - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00994.pdf
